Hi!
Created this project using tkinter and API from trivia(https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).
The only error you could face is maybe the json file has 0 entries or you have gonw through all the 50 questions,in that case you have to run the starting code again.
IDK but i have'nt coded the when start automatically run the get questions part but it still triggers somehow hence i have left it untouched.
If you get a json decoder error or any error related to the json file feel free to just run the Fetch_use.py file once then you should be good to go!!!
